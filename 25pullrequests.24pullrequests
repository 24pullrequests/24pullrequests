Contributors
Over hundreds of different people have contributed to the project, you can see them all here: https://github.com/24pullrequests/24pullrequests/graphs/contributors

Development
The source is hosted at GitHub.

You can report issues/feature requests on GitHub Issues. You can use GitHub Discussions to ask questions, follow announcements, and to propose ideas for the 24pullrequests project. Follow the project on Twitter @24pullrequests.

These instructions are for working on the the 24pullrequests.com website. If you just want to be a developer who contributes PRs during the holidays, you don't need to follow these instructions! Go to https://24pullrequests.com and get involved there.

Getting Started
Want to hack on the website? Awesome!

New to Ruby? No worries! You can follow these instructions to install a local server, or you can use the included Vagrant setup.

Installing a Local Server
First things first, you'll need to install Ruby 3.2.2. I recommend using the excellent rbenv, and ruby-build.

rbenv install 3.2.2
rbenv global 3.2.2
Next, you'll need to make sure that you have PostgreSQL installed. This can be done easily on macOS using Homebrew or by using https://postgresapp.com. Please see these further instructions for installing Postgres via Homebrew.

brew install postgres
brew install chrome-cli
On Debian-based Linux distributions you can use apt-get to install Postgres:

sudo apt-get install postgresql postgresql-contrib libpq-dev
On Windows, you can use the Chocolatey package manager to install Postgres:

choco install postgresql
Clone this repository:

git clone git@github.com:24pullrequests/24pullrequests.git
Now, let's install the gems from the Gemfile ("Gems" are synonymous with libraries in other languages).

gem install bundler && rbenv rehash
bundle install
Once all the gems are installed, we'll need to create the databases and tables. Rails makes this easy through the use of "Rake" tasks.

bundle exec rake db:create:all
bundle exec rake db:migrate
And we can also add some sample data with the seed task.

bundle exec rake db:seed
If you are working on anything related to the email-generation code, you can use MailCatcher. Since we use Bundler, please read the following before using MailCatcher.

Almost there! Now all we have to do is start up the Rails server and point our browser to http://localhost:3000

bundle exec rails s
Tests
Standard RSpec/Capybara tests are used for testing the application. The tests can be run with bundle exec rake.

You can set up the test environment with bundle exec rake db:test:prepare, which will create the test DB and populate its schema automatically. You don't need to do this for every test run, but it will let you easily keep up with migrations. If you find a large number of tests are failing you should probably run this.

If you are using the omniauth environment variables (GITHUB_KEY, GITHUB_SECRET, TWITTER_KEY, TWITTER_SECRET) for another project, you will need to either

unset them before running your tests or
reset the omniauth environment variables after creating a GitHub (omniauth) application for this project
as it will use it to learn more about the contributors and for pull requests.

Contributing
We are always looking for people to contribute! To find out how to help out, have a look at our Contributing Guide.

Translations
24 Pull Requests is available in twenty languages. Translations are managed on Transifex. Authentication is required to use Transifex. If you prefer to edit the translations directly you can use the standard Rails i18n framework. To get started:

Fork the project.
Create a copy of config/locales/en.yml within the locales folder.
Amend the first line with the correct character set you'll be translating to.
Translate the strings and submit a pull request for the new translation.
