      "body": "## 💥 Proposal\r\n\r\nAdd a third Theme options: Follow System Default theme.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nMost modern apps and websites offer at least 3 themes by default:\r\n\r\n- Light\r\n- Dark\r\n- System Default\r\n\r\nOctobox is missing the third one. The System Default theme would follow the theme set by the browser and automatically switch to the appropriate one accordingly.\r\n\r\nThe browser can also follow the System Default theme itself: If the user switches the OS theme to light or dark, the browser changes its theme, and then it would tell Octobox to change the theme as well.\r\n\r\n## Pitch\r\n\r\nSome modern OSs have the ability to detect the sunrise and sunset time based on the user's location, and switch to a light theme on sunrise or to a dark theme on sunset. This prevents eye strain.\r\n\r\nSome other OSs do not have the ability to detect sunrise/sunset, but the user can still manually switch to Light or Dark theme on demand.\r\n\r\nIn an ideal world, the user would _only_ switch the theme at the OS level, and _all_ apps would follow that setting.",

I would like to use Octobox to see all the issues I am assigned to, but most of them end up not being there because of the above issue.\r\n\r\n🎯 **Goal**\r\n<!--- Why is this change important to you?

You will see that only issues/PRs being changed/added THEREAFTER will show up in Octobox, even if you hit the Sync button and what not.\r\n\r\n### Versions, Operating System and Hardware\r\n\r\n- Which version/commit of Octobox are you using?  *Whichever is the one served on Octobox.io*\r\n- Which browser are you accessing Octobo with?  *Safari and Chrome, no difference*\r\n- Windows? Linux? Mac?  *Mac*\r\n- How are you deploying Octobox (Docker, Heroku, Openshift, etc)  *Using Octobox.io*\r\n\r\n### Additional comments\r\n\r\nI see the concept of Notifications being mentioned a lot in Octobox, which indicates it's using notifications to gather data from GitHub. But where you get info about the GitHub app it seems to suggest that if you install that, you will be able to suck in labels etc. Nowhere that I've read has there been anything suggesting that Octobox can only handle \"future\" issues/PRs or changes thereto. This seems highly unclear, given the symptoms I'm seeing, and should probably be clarified somewhere.",

Bonus: Be able to sort the repo groupings according to a custom ranking order.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\nIn our company we work on many repositories, which means issues from all those repos appear in the same list, intermingled with each other. I know there's a filtering mechanism to look at a single repo at a time, but often times I want to see issues from all repos, just a little bit more organized (i.e. grouped) into their respective repos.\r\n\r\n## Pitch\r\n\r\nOctobox claims to \"untangle your github notifications\", but seeing notifications from all repos mixed with each other is still \"tangled\". This feature would be a great push for octobox towards its goal ;)",
