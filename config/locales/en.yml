    description: 24 Pull Requests is a little project to promote open source collaboration
      during December.
    idea: The idea is basically "Send 24 pull requests between December 1st and December 24th",
      encouraging developers to give back to open source with little
      gifts of code throughout December.
    more_info: The site also provides suggested projects to help with, guides for
      contributing and highlights good pull requests submitted each day.
    on_github: 'Our code is located on GitHub:'
    on_twitter: 'We are also on Twitter:'
    sponsors:
      details: 24 Pull Requests was made possible thanks to the help and donations
        of some great sponsors.
      get_in_touch: 'If you’d like to get in touch about sponsorship or anything else,
        drop us an email:'
      thanks: Many thanks to...
