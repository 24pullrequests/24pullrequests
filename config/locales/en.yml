    description: 24 Pull Requests' goal is to encourage contribution to open source projects during December.

    more_info: The site suggests open projects, highlights tickets that are good for new contributors, provides <a href='/contributing'>guides for contributing</a> and promotes good contributions submitted each day.
    idea_title: Giving back to open source.
    idea_subtitle: Open source software has probably made you more productive this year. Let's give something back.
