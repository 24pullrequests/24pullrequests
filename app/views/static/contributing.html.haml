%h1 Contributing

%p There are lots of different ways that you can contribute to open source projects:

%ul
  %li
    %p
      %strong Open issues -
      often projects will have open issues that you can help out with, providing support or patches so they can be closed.
  %li
    %p
      %strong New features -
      perhaps a library is missing a killer feature, can you add it? Often it's worth speaking with the maintainer before starting big features to see if it will be merged.
  %li
    %p
      %strong Documentation fixes -
      clarifications of parts you find confusing, inconsistencies with current behavior, etc.
  %li
    %p
      %strong Convention fixes -
      are mostly binary checks names IsFoo() but one is named Foo_exists() ? do a quick refactor patch for it. Is one Exception named oddly, or have an unclear message?
  %li
    %p
      %strong Examples -
      does an example highlighting something you're confused about exist? Once you figure it out, whip up an example and contribute. Others are also confused about it - I promise.
  %li
    %p
      %strong Code commenting -
      do the comments contradict the code? Is there something in the code that confuses you? Once you figure it out, fix it and submit.
  %li
    %p
      %strong Testing -
      clone the repo and run the tests, do you get any failures, do you notice any areas lacking in coverage? Testing is also a great way to find out more about the internal working of the project.
