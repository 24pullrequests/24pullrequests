%h1 JSON API

%p Little know fact that there is a JSON api for 24 Pull Requests, details of each end point below:

%h3 Pagination

%p Requests that return multiple items will be paginated to 99 items by default. You can specify further pages with the ?page parameter. 

%pre
  :plain
    $ curl http://24pullrequests.com/users.json?page=2

%h3 JSON-P Callbacks

%p You can send a ?callback parameter to any GET call to have the results wrapped in a JSON function. This is typically used when browsers want to embed content in web pages by getting around cross domain issues. The response includes the same data output as the regular API.

%pre
  :plain
    $ curl http://24pullrequests.com/users.json?callback=foo
