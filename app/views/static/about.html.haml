%h2 About 24 Pull Requests

%p 24 Pull Requests is a little project to promote open source collaboration during December.

%p The idea is basically "Send a pull request every day in December leading up to Christmas", encouraging developers to give back to open source with little gifts of code throughout December.

%p The site also provides suggested projects to help with, guides for contributing and highlights good pull requests submitted each day.

%p
  The site development is open source on GitHub:
