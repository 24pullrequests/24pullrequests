<h1>Contributing</h1>
<p>There are lots of different ways that you can contribute to open source projects:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Open issues -</strong>
      often projects will have open issues that you can help out with, providing support or patches so they can be closed.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>New features -</strong>
      perhaps a library is missing a killer feature, can you add it? Often it’s worth speaking with the maintainer before starting big features to see if it will be merged.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Documentation fixes -</strong>
      clarifications of parts you find confusing, inconsistencies with current behavior, spelling and grammar fixes, etc.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Convention fixes -</strong>
      are most binary checks named IsFoo() but one is named Foo_exists() ? Do a quick refactor patch for it. Is one Exception named oddly, or have an unclear message?
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Examples -</strong>
      does an example highlighting something you’re confused about exist? Once you figure it out, whip up an example and contribute. Others are also confused about it - I promise.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Code commenting -</strong>
      do the comments contradict the code? Is there something in the code that confuses you? Once you figure it out, fix it and submit.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Testing -</strong>
      clone the repo and run the tests. Do you get any failures? Do you notice any areas lacking in coverage? Testing is also a great way to find out more about the internal workings of the project.
